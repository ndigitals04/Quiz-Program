## 🧩 How It Works

- The quiz questions are stored in a dictionary called base_questions where: Each key is a question (string). 
- Each value is a list of 4 options (the correct answer is always the first item).
- The program presents questions randomly and shuffles the options before displaying them.

- User selects an answer by typing 'a', 'b', 'c', or 'd'.

- All responses are stored and analyzed at the end to calculate the user's score.

- After completing the quiz, the user is shown their total score and the program ends.
